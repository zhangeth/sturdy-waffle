# Welcome to the jsonschema-serverless-crud respository!
This respository is designed to make setting up your own CRUD API as easy as possible. All you have to do is template the repository and follow the steps listed in the [Wiki Homepage](https://github.com/sandeepzgk/jsonschema-serverless-crud/wiki).

## Things you will need
To use this repo, you will need a JSON Schema (and corresponding UI Schema) that describes the data that you are trying to store in the CRUD application. Other than that, you will need to have/create an AWS, Google Developer, and Serverless.com account.
